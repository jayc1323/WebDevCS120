        A link and description of my <b>favorite restaurant</b>.
        <a href="http://alarabianexpress.com/">Al Arabian Express</a> <br>
        I like this restaurant as it serves one of my favorite dishes which is the Shawarma.<br>
        It also serves other Middle Eastern and Indian dishes like Biryani, Naan , Tandoori starters and Indian Gravy.

        <img src="https://github.com/jayc1323/WebDevCS120/blob/main/misal_pav2.jpg" alt="Misal Pav" style="float:left;">
        The dish in the image is <b>Misal Pav</b>. It is a traditional dish from Maharashtra, India. It is famous in Maharashtra and is usually had at lunch.<br>
        It consists of a thin spicy dark gravy called Misal which consists of Sprouts ,onions, red chillies. It is eaten with a Pav, which is the bread.<br>
        The dish is very spicy and people usually start sweating when they start eating it and therefore some curd is provided to give them some relief.<br>
        For people who are accustomed to this dish, some more spicy gravy called Rassa can be added. A Papad, which is a crispy item is also served with this dish.<br>
        This dish is very famous in my hometown and restaurants who serve this dish have long waiting lines on Sundays.
